      <p>If you landed here it probably means you want to know a bit more about who I am or what this site is all about. Let me try to answer those questions.</p>

      <h2>The short version</h2>

      <p>I'm a developer and designer based in a small town. I've been building things for the web since the early 2010s and writing on this blog since 2017. If you want to chat, you can reach me at <a href="mailto:hello@example.com">hello@example.com</a>.</p>

      <h2>The longer version</h2>

      <p>I grew up in a quiet part of the world, spent most of my school years being fascinated by computers and the internet. After trying a few different paths in education, I eventually found my way to web development and never looked back. There's something about building things for the web that feels right — the openness, the accessibility, the creative freedom.</p>

      <p>I started freelancing shortly after and have been working independently ever since. It's not always easy — the freedom comes with uncertainty, and the flexibility comes with a tendency to never truly stop working. But I wouldn't trade it for the predictability of a typical office job. At least, not most days.</p>

      <p>Outside of work, I'm drawn to nature, mountains, and quiet places. Cities have their charm but I find myself happiest when surrounded by trees and open sky. One day I'd love to have a small place somewhere remote, with enough space to breathe and think.</p>

      <p>I share my life with a dog who is simultaneously the best and worst decision I've ever made. He's large, stubborn, and endlessly entertaining.</p>

      <h2>Online presence</h2>

      <p>I stepped away from social media a while ago and don't miss it. My writing lives here on this blog, and occasionally I share things on <a href="https://are.na">Are.na</a>. I believe in owning your own content and keeping things simple. The web is better when people have their own spaces rather than renting attention on platforms.</p>

      <h2>About this site</h2>

      <p>I designed and built this site myself. It's intentionally minimal — no analytics, no trackers, no unnecessary JavaScript. Just words, images, and the occasional link. The typeface is Iowan, a beautiful serif that's easy on the eyes for long reading sessions.</p>

      <p>The site is always a work in progress. I enjoy tweaking small details, adjusting spacing, and refining the reading experience. It's as much a creative outlet as the writing itself.</p>

      <h2>Get in touch</h2>

      <p>I'm a big fan of email. My inbox is always open and I enjoy hearing from people. Whether you have a question about my work, want to discuss an idea, or just want to say hello — feel free to reach out at <a href="mailto:hello@example.com">hello@example.com</a>.</p>
